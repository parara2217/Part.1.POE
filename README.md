1. The first thing that happens when running my code/program is the image will immediately appear(although the image is huge it does appear).
   -The image is regenerated by ASCII.
2. Next is the voice greeting(Wav audio) will play.
3. After that there will be a border, then the greeting message (Hello! Welcome to the Cybersecurity Awareness Bot. I'm here to help you stay safe online.) will be displayed.
4. From there the ChatBot will ask the user for their name.
   -even if the user decided to skip or not enter the name, the bot will ask uptil a name is provided.
5. The ChatBot will then ask how it can help regarding Cybersecurity related questions, the user will decide to ask or not
   -if a question is asked about anything related to cybersecurity, an answer will be displayed related to the question
   -this time if the user decided not to ask a question related to cybersecurity the program will display that a question was not asked and the program will end.
6. And finally if the user decided to end the program, he/she can press the enter button twice to end it
